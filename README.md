# PreciseGAN
A research repo for studying different techniques towards making more precise GANs

## Experiment reproduction

To reproduce experiment first you need data, that can be downloaded with `get_csv.sh` script.
Then you should learn and dump `MinMaxScaler` with script `init_scaler.py`, and make train/test data split
with `init_data.py`

Then run `main.py`
